# Assignment: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

## Assignment Objectives

* Increase familiarity with Pandas and SciKit Learn libraries for data cleaning
* Learn how to work with messy datasets
* Learn how to combine different datasets
* Understand the importance of data preprocessing for improving model performance
* Gain experience in encoding categorical features and normalizing numerical features

## Pre-requisites

* Knowledge of the basic syntax of Python is expected


## Overview

A team of doctors and scientists have been working to combat Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). They've collected detailed medical data from 400 patients. This dataset is crucial for understanding and predicting CKD. Your mission is to clean and preprocess this dataset to prepare it for machine learning!

You'll be given 2 dirty datasets. Apply data cleaning techniques using pandas functions to create a clean and preprocessed dataset.

## Useful Tutorials and Documentation

### Pandas

There are many different data loading/analysis libraries out there for python but don't reinvent the wheel. Pandas is by far the most universally used library for manipulating datasets. It includes tools for loading datasets, slicing/combining the data, and easily transforming back and forth to NumPy primitives. The following tutorials should cover some but not all the tools you will need to complete this assignment.

* [How do I read and write tabular data?](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/02_read_write.html)
* [pandas.DataFrame.dropna](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.dropna.html)
* [pandas.get_dummies](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.get_dummies.html)
