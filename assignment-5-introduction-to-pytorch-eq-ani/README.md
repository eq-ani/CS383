# Assignment 5: Introduction to PyTorch

## Overview

This assignment introduces you to PyTorch, one of the most popular deep learning frameworks used in industry and research. You'll learn the fundamentals of PyTorch's tensor operations and build neural network models to solve classification problems.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will:
- Understand PyTorch tensors and their operations
- Learn how to create and manipulate tensors
- Implement basic machine learning models using PyTorch
- Build and train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network
- Experiment with hyperparameter tuning for model optimization

## Assignment Structure

### Section 1: PyTorch Tensors
In this section, you'll learn about PyTorch tensors - the fundamental data structure for deep learning operations. You'll explore tensor creation, manipulation, and various operations that are essential for building neural networks.

### Section 2: Machine Learning Workflow (Demo)
This section demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow using the Iris dataset. You'll see how to:
- Load and preprocess data
- Create custom datasets and dataloaders
- Build a simple logistic regression model
- Train the model and evaluate its performance

### Section 3: Multi-Layer Perceptron with Titanic Dataset
In this section, you'll apply what you've learned to build a more complex neural network - a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) - to predict survival on the Titanic. You'll:
- Preprocess the Titanic dataset
- Create a custom dataset class
- Build an MLP model with multiple layers
- Train and evaluate the model
- Experiment with hyperparameter tuning to improve performance

## Why PyTorch?

PyTorch has become one of the most popular frameworks for deep learning research and applications for several reasons:

1. **Intuitive Design**: PyTorch offers a natural, Pythonic interface that makes it easy to learn and use.

2. **Dynamic Computation Graph**: Unlike some other frameworks, PyTorch builds the computation graph dynamically, allowing for more flexible model architectures and easier debugging.

3. **Rich Ecosystem**: PyTorch has a vibrant community and extensive libraries for various applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.

4. **Industry Adoption**: Many top tech companies and research institutions use PyTorch for their AI projects.

5. **Seamless Integration**: PyTorch works well with Python's scientific computing stack (NumPy, pandas, etc.).

## Prerequisites

To succeed in this assignment, you should have:
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with NumPy arrays
- Basic knowledge of machine learning concepts
- Understanding of neural networks and backpropagation

## Getting Started

1. Read through the entire notebook to get an overview of the assignment
2. Complete the sections marked with "TODO" comments
